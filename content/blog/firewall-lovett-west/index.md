Thrillers and mysteries are some of my favorite genres to read. So, when I was offered an advance copy of Firewall by Eugenia Lovett West, I had to accept! Firewall is part of a bigger series featuring main character Emma Streat. Even though I haven’t read the other books, the blurb piqued my interest enough to give this a read.

>A fast-paced, globe-trotting story of passion, heartbreak, and deception…
>
>When Emma Streat’s rich, socialite godmother is threatened with blackmail, Emma is plunged into the dark world of cybercrime. Mounting dangers take her to exclusive places in Europe, and she becomes involved with elite personalities in financial and art collecting circles and has intriguing experiences with men, including her dynamic ex-lover Lord Andrew Rodale. Targeted by a cybercrime network with cutting-edge technology, it takes all the resilience and wits Emma has to survive and bring a ruthless criminal to justice.

One of the first things that got my attention was the phrase “intriguing experiences with men”. That felt like such a weird adjective to use in this context, but it made me want to read more, which is what a good blurb should do. (Spoiler: “Intriguing” really is the best word; Emma’s relationships are … atypical)

The book starts off with Emma investigating her godmother Catherine’s blackmail (Apparently, this opera singer proved her crime-solving abilities in the last two books). Hoping to pin this on one of Catherine’s ex-husbands, she flies to France to meet with Rodale, who’s also after the same guy, for different reasons. Emma’s lead seems to be a dead end, but that’s when her problems only begin. She becomes a target to a dangerous group and is thrown into one crazy situation after another. Emma is no stranger to attempts on her life, so she relies on her quick thinking, connections, and luck to make it out alive every time. To say this book is “fast-paced” is right! It kept me guessing all the way through the end. Just when I thought I knew where things were headed, West threw in a twist that made me rethink everything. 

If I had to complain about anything, I would say that the characters felt unrealistic and even a little cliché. Let me introduce Emma again: She was a famous opera singer until she lost her voice (the irony!). Her husband was murdered. Then, her house was set on fire. Despite these setbacks, she manages to raise two seemingly well-adjusted boys and sends them off to college. AND she has a wealthy godmother with the right connections for every situation?? Almost every character has an extraordinary backstory like Emma’s. Even for fiction, that’s a little too much for me. I’ve admitted that I didn’t read the last two books, so I didn’t get to see all of this develop slowly. That being said, this book certainly lives up to its genre, so I’d recommend it to anyone who likes mystery. The fact that it deals with cybercrime brings a modern element that readers will enjoy. My only advice would be to read the other books first. It’s not impossible to read this without the extra context, but you’ll like it better if you do. 

Firewall is available wherever books are sold starting November 5, 2019.
