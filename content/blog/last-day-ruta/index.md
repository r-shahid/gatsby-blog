What if you knew when the world would end? That’s the premise of Last Day by Domenica Ruta. Each year, people prepare for the end of the world. Every May 28th, humanity celebrates the end with religious ceremonies, fairs, and personal traditions like apologizing to the people they’ve wronged throughout the year. In this book, we follow four individuals as they observe this “holiday” on Earth as well as three astronauts on the International Space Station. Their lives are as far apart as can be, but throughout the book, we see how they interconnect and overlap.

Domenica Ruta creates a beautiful, vibrant story about a morbid scenario. The word that comes to mind when I think about her writing is “real”. When I consider her characters and their thought processes, I can imagine each one in my mind. Nothing feels forced, which is an impressive accomplishment considering this book is about the end of the world.

While I enjoyed this book overall, I’m not a huge fan of this type of writing style, where the story jumps back and forth between vastly different characters. Multiple perspectives do make for a more interesting story, but I had such big gaps between readings that I was a little disoriented every time I picked up this book again. I started this book towards the end of my final semester at NYU, so between final exams and graduation prep, I often went several days without reading. Now that I’ve graduated, I plan on making reading more of a priority. I’m curious to read Domenica Ruta’s debut novel With Or Without You, since I really do think of her as a great writer.
