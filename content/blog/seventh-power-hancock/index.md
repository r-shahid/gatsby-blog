The Seventh Power was published February 25, 2020. I received a free copy for review, but all opinions expressed are my own. 

>“[Organizations] are most effective when the opportunity and responsibility for leading is shared broadly and embraced by all. Power, it turns out, is meant to be dispersed.”

You might not know of Kevin Hancock, but the Hancock Lumber Company has been around for almost 200 years. In 2010, Hancock was diagnosed with spasmodic dysphonia, rendering him unable to speak easily. A couple of years later, Hancock began visiting the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota to heal and regain his voice. It was here that he realized that like him, this community did not feel fully heard. While Hancock literally lost his voice, there are entire groups who have had their voices silenced throughout history. This realization led Hancock on a journey around the world to study leadership principles that serve to disperse power, ultimately crafting a set of guidelines for a reimagined work culture.

Before I get into my review, I want to address where the title comes from. In Lakota culture, a medicine wheel represents six great powers: the four cardinal directions, the sky, and the earth. At the center of the wheel lies individual human spirit. This is the seventh power and according to Hancock, the key to making our workplaces better. 

The rest of this book evokes the image of a medicine wheel to illustrate the circular forms of power dispersal (or lack thereof) in most organizations. Usually workplaces are set up for those in the “center” to amass the most power. This power comes from the workers who make up the outside of the circle. Instead, Hancock argues that power should radiate outwards, from the CEOs and bosses to the individual employees. Operating in this way will allow for the highest celebration of the human spirit, which leads to increased productivity.

Hancock also uses the wheel imagery for his Seven Lessons for the Age of Shared Leadership, which he reveals one by one throughout the book. Each lesson is a part of the circle that leads into the next before starting over. Of the seven, the one that stood out to me was “Change is created first from within.” This may not make the most sense without the context of the other six lessons, but in short, leaders should work on themselves to set an example for their team before expecting a new result from them. 

>"The problem with a preoccupation with external enemies is the opportunity cost of internal explorations."

The focus on the “internal” is a subject that comes up again and again throughout the book (which, by the way is full of really great, quotable lines like the one above). Instead of wondering what the average worker can do to serve the company better, Hancock wants leaders to forget the idea that the workers are the problem. The people serving your company should never be seen as an “external enemy.” Instead, those in charge should look inward to identify what they themselves can do to expedite the change they want to see from others. 

>"Leadership is about becoming the change. [Consider] something that frustrates you […] Then turn inward and focus on what you have done to create the environment that supports that which frustrates you." 

While most of us are not business owners and CEOs (yet), I think some of Hancock’s words can be applied to the interactions we have with just about anybody. For example, if I have a coworker who I feel isn’t contributing the way they should be, I can ask myself if there’s anything I can do differently in order to get the level of cooperation I want. If not, then I can try to find out whether they’re having some sort of problem that keeps them from performing. Here, I would have to “listen for understanding, not judgement” (another one of the Seven Lessons). Only when my coworker feels like they’ve been able to fully convey their thoughts and concerns can they be ready to work on challenging themselves. 

Beyond this, I do have to reiterate that this is a book about business and that not all the advice should be applied elsewhere. There is heavy emphasis on a change-and-success-comes-from-within type of attitude, but I feel this takes away the focus from systemic issues that oppress us. The Lakota and other indigenous groups are not voiceless due to their own failure to change and adapt to the modern world. They have been systemically disenfranchised. They continue to be under-served and held at a disadvantage by the government. And speaking of the Lakota, I have to admit that I felt a little uncomfortable at some points of this book. Hancock takes on so many Lakota concepts while not being indigenous himself. It made me question whether his adoption of these values would be considered appropriation. Hancock actually addresses this at the end, in a chapter called “The Elephant in the Room.” While people would be right to think that an indigenous person would be the best representative for their group, the issues the Lakota face are not their sole responsibility to fix. Hancock affirms that this is a broader, human issue. One that won’t get solved if those who aren’t directly impacted “stay in their lane.” If the problem is that this group has been silenced and excluded from the conversation, then opening up that line of communication is a step in the right direction.
