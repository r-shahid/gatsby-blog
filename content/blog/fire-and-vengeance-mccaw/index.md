I received an advance copy for review, but all opinions expressed are my own. 

_Fire and Vengeance_ is a mystery surrounding Hawai’ian Chief Detective Koa Kane. When an elementary school is built on a volcanic vent and the following explosion kills 14 students, Kane must pursue justice. Things get more sinister when the school’s contractor and architect are murdered soon after. People in power knew about the vent and chose to build the school there anyway. Kane must figure out who is responsible and why they did this. Throughout his investigation, Kane uncovers a conspiracy and several obscure connections, including one to his own brother, who’s already in prison for burglary. By the end, Kane must choose between saving his brother and doing what’s right for the victims. 

I was offered an advance reader’s copy a few months ago, in March. Mystery is one of my favorite genres, so I had to accept once I read the premise. Now, it’s hard to talk about this book without thinking of the present reality of cop/civilian relations. We live in a world where our police system, as it stands, does not serve the best interests of the people. **Our expectations of justice do not match reality following injustice**. That being said, I’m going to review this book based on McCaw’s merits as a storyteller. 

Some background on our protagonist Koa Kane: He is an ex-army man who eventually became a cop due to the guilt he felt after one of his friends died to save his life while they were deployed. When Kane was younger, his father, who worked at a sugar mill, died in an “accident” arranged by the mill manager in response to his father’s union activities. Kane wanted revenge, so he went to the manager’s home to attack him but accidentally killed him instead. To cover it up, Kane staged the manager’s suicide and left his door open so that the wild pigs that roam Hawai’i would eat him. His plan worked and he didn’t get in any trouble, but Kane carries this guilt into adulthood. _****I’m going to be honest, this part felt a little too real for me, given the number of real-life cops who have been caught or suspected of staging suicides — Brian Fanion, Ken Bluew, and Matthew Boynton to name a few._ 

The book opens with news of the explosion. The KonaWili school was built on top of a volcanic vent on the side of Hualalai Mountain, one of the volcanoes that make up Hawai’i. While everyone is reasonably devastated, further investigation reveals that this could have been avoided. To look for survivors in the rubble, investigators use a robot with a camera to explore parts of the school unsafe for rescuers to enter. The first discovery was the existence of a basement. This was a little unexpected because of the rocky land the school was built on, but what they found next was even worse. Hidden in the basement was an area sealed off with six-foot-thick walls. Beyond these walls was the volcanic vent. This proved that at least one person involved in building the school knew about the vent and the risk involved in trying to seal it off. Whoever was liable would be guilty of murder by reckless endangerment. 

Kane knew he had to investigate everyone involved in building the school but before he can even begin, a construction worker and the architect are found dead. Hank Boyle, the construction worker, appears to have hung himself, but details about the scene just didn’t add up. To make things more suspicious, a file about the school’s construction is missing from his cabinet. Architect Arthur Witherspoon is also found dead, but it’s clear that someone shot him. A gun is found at the airport with a serial number matching one that was stolen from a nearby military base. Kane must uncover who is responsible, but this task is far from simple. A lot of powerful individuals had something to gain in the school being built there and everyone stays tight-lipped when questioned.

This tragedy is a result of greed, fraud, and conspiracy, which is interesting on its own, but McCaw’s writing really pulls the reader in. I’ll be honest, when I first started reading this book, it was slow-going because there were a lot of names and character descriptions, but once I got into the “meat” of it, I couldn’t put the book down! I was at the edge of my seat, wondering what would be revealed next. And even though this is part of a bigger series, I would say it’s possible to read this as a stand-alone book. Any references to Kane’s past were explained well-enough to make sense for the current book.

I also really liked how Hawai’ian culture was incorporated throughout the writing. Kane uses many Hawai’ian words that are not always explicitly defined, but it’s easy enough to figure out what they mean based on the context. There are also references to Hawai’ian lore, like Pele, the goddess of volcanoes.

Another big part of the story is Kane’s family life. I mentioned that his brother has gotten into trouble for burglary, but things get more complicated when it’s discovered that he has a brain tumor that may have been the cause of his delinquent lifestyle. The contrast between Kane as a sharp, keen detective and the softer family man was nice, but felt too stark at times. By the end, Kane’s brother’s fate is directly related to the outcome of the KonaWili disaster, but there was just so much going on there. 

Overall, this was a well-written, fast-paced book that I think most readers will enjoy. To learn more about the book and author Robert McCaw, check out [his website](https://robertbmccaw.com/).
