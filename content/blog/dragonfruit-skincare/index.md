In this post, I wanted to highlight an indie skincare brand I’ve been using lately. A few weeks ago, Vanessa from Dragon Fruit Skin Care sent me a few of their products to try out.

Dragon Fruit Skin Care is a POC/woman-owned brand centered on the belief that plants have a lot to offer when it comes to taking care of our skin. All of the products are things the owner uses herself. Each item is hand-made in small batches, so you know what you’re getting is fresh, too. 

I first found out about Dragon Fruit Skin Care when I saw one of their ads on my Instagram feed. I was drawn by their aesthetic, which is bold, vivid colors with hints of Y2K, vaporwave, and what I think is a little bit of e-girl. 

This brand’s tagline is “Plant Based Ancestral Knowledge.” They embody this in their products by using 100% vegan and natural ingredients and never testing on animals. Synthetic ingredients are not inherently bad, but if you want to go the all-natural route, more power to ya! I do want to point out that DFSC products do not contain parabens or any other preservatives, so you have to be mindful about using up what you have in a timely manner, before they expire. I know I won’t have an issue with that because everything I’ve tried has been a win!

### LUNA SERUM

Despite the name, this is a face oil. I have combination/oily skin, so for a long time I avoided oily products. I didn’t believe that the oils themselves were bad, I just didn’t like how they felt on my skin. Turns out, I was using the wrong oils! [Luna Serum](https://www.dragonfruitskincare.com/product-page/luna-serum) has a base of jojoba oil, which is well-known for having very similar properties to the sebum naturally produced by our skin. It absorbs easily and does not irritate most people’s skin. I apply just three drops to my whole face at night, after a light serum. My skin feels soft right after applying and stays moisturized until morning. This contains tea tree oil to help heal acne, but my skin just doesn’t respond to it. I still like the herbal scent of tea tree though, so it’s not a loss at all. 

##### INGREDIENTS

* JOJOBA OIL – an emollient oil (technically, a wax on a chemical level) that locks in moisture. Also a rich source of fatty acids that work to soothe the skin. Feels less greasy than other oils because of how quickly/easily it absorbs into the skin

* ROSEHIP SEED OIL – an emollient that contains antioxidants like vitamin A and C. This will help with cell regeneration, which is amazing if you have hyperpigmentation or uneven skin. 

* PRICKLY PEAR SEED OIL – contains high amounts of vitamin E (more than argan oil!) and linoleic acid, which is good for hyperpigmentation and moisturizing the skin. Also includes vitamin K, which has brightening properties, and zinc to reduce redness. 

* TEA TREE OIL – an antioxidant with soothing, anti inflammatory properties. It’s also antimicrobial, so it can help fight acne
