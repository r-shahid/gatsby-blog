At the end of last year, I made a goal to myself to read 36 books in 2018. Here are the books I actually read.

1. **John Dies at the End by David Wong**

   This book was on my list for a very long time. I would recommend this if you like funny sci-fi books.

2. **Home by Toni Morrison**

   This was my first Toni Morrison book but it certainly won’t be the last.

3. **The Complete Persepolis by Marjane Satrapi**

   I first heard of this book when I was in middle school but I never got around to reading it until now. I found the political aspects fascinating, since I didn’t really know anything about it before. Reading this book was a delight thanks to Satrapi’s art style and voice as a writer.

4. **Turtles All The Way Down by John Green**

   As someone who is dealing with anxiety for the first time, I really appreciated seeing a fair representation of it in a book. That being said, I felt that parts of this novel were too philosophical, especially since the characters are high school students. Maybe I’m getting past the point where I can actually enjoying reading about teens and their problems.

5. **Egghead: Or, You Can’t Survive On Ideas Alone by Bo Burnham**

   If you read Shel Silverstein as a kid, then think of this as a grown-up version … written by a comedian. I enjoyed reading these poems because most of them are pretty silly and funny. There are a few that I felt were vulgar just for the sake of being vulgar (I didn’t like these as much) but others are unexpectedly deep in their social commentary. Overall, I finished this book on a positive note.

6. **Alfred and Guinevere by James Schuyler**

   I picked up this book because I wanted something short to read in one sitting (it took me three train rides). This book doesn’t have much of a plot. It’s told from the point of view of two children, Alfred and Guinevere, as they spend the summer with their grandmother. Most of the book is written as Guinevere’s diary with sections of dialogue throughout. It was pleasant to read but I wouldn’t say that Schuyler “has a pitch-perfect ear for children’s voices,” as the back cover’s summary claims. Some parts felt too sophisticated to be relatable. Overall, I wouldn’t go so far as to say this book is bad, but I wouldn’t recommend it either.

7. **Self Made by Nely Galán Galán**

   This book tells the story of her journey in the entertainment industry from an unpaid intern as a teenager to the president of Telemundo. She gives advice from everything she learned along the way, as well as stories of other women who have become self made. I like reading about successful women so I really enjoyed the “inside perspectives” that this book offered. I felt that parts of Galán’s experience were based on luck (like buying her first building when the previous owner just so happened to need to move across the country) but I found this book motivational nonetheless.

8. **The Handmaid’s Tale by Margaret Atwood**

   I am conflicted about my final opinion of this book. On one hand, I like the way Atwood builds the structure of the dystopian Gilead, showing the readers how power is flexed in that society. But I had so many questions about how people would even let their society get to this point without greater resistance. Mikki Kendall’s reaction summarizes this well: “It requires me to believe that not only are my people gone, but often that they vanished quietly without any real resistance. As if. Like…Black people did not survive slavery, Jim Crow & the War on Drugs to be taken out by a handful of white boys with guns.”

9. **Uncommon Type: Some Stories by Tom Hanks**

   I saw this on a “New Fiction” shelf at my local library and HAD to grab it while checking out my other books. I’m a big fan of Tom Hanks as an actor and respect his love for typewriters (as a typewriter-owner myself). I somehow didn’t understand that each of the “chapters” was an independent short story, so I was very confused at first when I got to the second chapter/story in this book. Hanks uses some of the same characters in the different stories so it was not clear to me that they were not sequential. Once I got past my confusion, I found that I thoroughly enjoyed most of the stories in this collection. I really hope Hanks continues to write more fiction (and expands on stories like Go See Costas).

10. **The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous and Broke by Suze Orman**

    I found this book on /r/personalfinance’s reading list. I’m not the most financially savvy person, so I thought it would be a good way to educate myself in this area. Orman’s book is structured in a very newbie-friendly way. Each chapter covers a different aspect of personal finance, making it easy for readers to pick and choose what is most relevant to them. Within each chapter, Orman starts with a few pages of general information, before shifting to a question-and-answer format. This made it easy for me to quickly skim through a chapter and identify which parts I could use in my life. For example, I don’t have any student loans, so I skipped over the discussions pertaining to paying back those debts.

11. **The Dinner by Herman Koch**

    This had been on my “Books to Read” list for a while. So long, in fact, that I have no idea where I first heard of it. Regardless, I found this book to be fairly enjoyable. If anything, I would say that this book kept me on my toes. As the title suggests, this book takes place during a family dinner between two brothers and their wives. The couples’ sons have committed a serious crime and the parents must discuss what happens next. As the four adults eat their way through the night, Koch reveals one secret after another, each one more intriguing than the last. Overall, I wouldn’t classify this as a thriller, but the suspenseful revelations kept me guessing all the way to the end.

12. **Little Fires Everywhere by Celeste Ng**

    A baby is given away to a family who’s been trying to adopt for ages. The mother realizes she can’t offer her daughter the necessities for survival, so she does the only thing she can think of and leaves the baby with people who could offer her a better life. But later, mom gets a job, becomes more stable, and she decides she wants her baby back. She wants her child to grow up with the woman who gave birth to her. Just at this point, you could argue endlessly in favor of either side. Mom lost her rights when she “abandoned” her baby. She should have tried to get social support another way. But giving up a baby is a desperate mistake. A baby belongs with her mother when the mother is willing and able to care for her. Now throw in race and privilege. Baby and mom are East Asian, while the adoptive family is white. No matter how hard they try, they’ll never be able to give the baby the chance to embrace her Asian culture. White people will say she’s not white enough, while Asian people will say she’s too white to relate to them. The baby will grow into a child who never feels like she fully belongs anywhere. The white family is wealthier than the single Asian mother. They have more money for better lawyers, while the single mom must rely on the charity of others. The family can provide more in terms of material needs, but can anything weigh heavier than the care from a loving biological mother? Little Fires Everywhere is about how this situation impacts and divides a small town, where everyone knows each other’s business and has an opinion. It looks at all the ugly bits of the relationships that people have with each other and how they cover them up in ways that characterize (racist) suburban life. It also ties in the ways each person changes as they grow, and how this stretches and shapes the bonds you never expect to change.

13. **The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas**

    I’m going to be honest. I passed over this book for a long time only because I didn’t like the cover. The sign that Starr holds says “The Hate U Give” with all text aligned to the left. It annoyed me that it wasn’t centered. Somehow, it didn’t occur to me that the first letter of each word spells out “thug”! Boy did I feel silly. Overall, I feel that I am older than the target audience, but I had heard a lot about this book, so I decided to give it a read. It’s about a girl, Starr, and they way her relationships with her family and friends unfold and evolve after a tragic shooting in her neighborhood. It’s extremely relevant in our current socio-political situation in the US. While reading, I couldn’t help but feel that I would be disappointed by the ending. I thought that we either would get a sad outcome, which is disappointing in its own right, or an (unfortunately) unrealistic happy ending, where justice is served and the cop is held accountable for his actions. I worried that this book would be something people would look to as a “dream scenario”, something that could not happen in reality. But, Angie Thomas does a great job of finding the right balance between realistic and hopeful, and for that, I applaud her. One small comment that I have however, is that it felt weird to read references to memes in books. It makes me feel really old.

14. **Carrie by Stephen King**

    This was one of those books that everyone kind of knows the plot of without having read it. I always got the references to the telekinetic hormonal teenager whose name makes up the title of this book, but I never actually read it until this year! I love most of Stephen King’s books, so I was glad to have added this to my list.

15. **Sophie’s World by Jostein Gaarder**

    If someone were to say “Let’s come up with a book that teaches readers general philosophy, but isn’t a philosophy textbook,” this book would be it. The passages where Alberto lectures Sophie or when Sophie reads from Alberto’s letters are thinly veiled philosophy lessons to the reader. These sections can get pretty dense, so I found myself skimming through most of them towards the end of the book. Aside from these lessons, the rest of the book is very engaging. [mild spoilers ahead] At the beginning of the book, you start with one main universe: Sophie and Alberto’s. But as you read through the book, Gaarder introduces Hilde and her mother. Somewhere between them is Albert Knag, who links Sophie’s world to Hilde’s. By the end of the book, universes fall apart and leave you wondering about your own existence and it’s relation to what possibly lies beyond it.

16. **‘Salem’s Lot by Stephen King**

    Reading this book was another way for the universe to show me that I don’t like Stephen King’s longer stories. I’m an impatient reader. If I have to read more than halfway into a horror novel before anything scary happens, I’m not going to have a fun time. King does such a great job of building the character’s individual stories, that it takes a while for the plot to move along. I don’t like this so much because I like being able to think about the characters myself and fill in the gaps of who they are outside of the book’s story (see #18), so I could do with less exposition. But I’m sure some of you may enjoy this book.

17. **The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson**

    This book was on my list to read ever since the show became available on Netflix. I wanted to hold off on watching it until I read the book first, but in a moment of boredom and laziness, I streamed every episode in one weekend! I didn’t read the book until a couple of weeks later, but I still enjoyed it after watching the show. If you didn’t know already, the Netflix show takes its title and main storyline from Shirley Jackson’s book, but deviates enough to not spoil the book if you haven’t read it yet. Even though nothing was spoiled, I do wish I had waited to watch the show. The show uses the same names as the characters in the book, but their relationships to each other are different. There were moments in the book that felt weird because I kept comparing them to the characters in the show. It’s nearly impossible to watch something and then picture anyone other than the actor when reading about them later. It wasn’t a huge deal, but I would have liked to imagine my own characters, instead of picturing the actors as I was reading. I’ll take this is as a lesson learned for next time!

18. **The End We Start From by Megan Hunter**

    You know the book (and movie) The Road? This is like The Road, but without baby cannibalism (to the reader’s knowledge). It reads like the sporadic thoughts a person might log into their journal as they try to hold onto any shred of sanity in a world devastated by tragedy. As you read this book, you don’t understand what’s going on in the world, but you understand why the characters behave the way they do. Not knowing makes it better (cough cough #16) because you can make it as tame as you can handle. Or as awful as each character deserves.

19. **Annie John by Jamaica Kincaid**

    I think about this book a lot. Probably more than I should. A girl, Annie John, spends her childhood admiring her mother and cherishing every moment they spend together. Eventually, Annie John’s focus shifts to the mortality to which adults are closer. Everything she loved before turns sour and leads to betrayal in Annie John’s mind. Eventually, Annie John is old enough to leave her home, leaving the reader wondering what her relationships with her family will be like going forward. Overall, I found this story to be relatable in that everyone experiences changing relationships with their parents. For young girls, the first major change tends to happen during puberty, as it did for Annie John.

20. **Beloved by Toni Morrison**

    This was a powerful book in showing the lengths people will go to for the people they love. While there is a ghost in this book, this isn’t spooky ghost story. It’s about slavery and the ways it continues to bind its victims long after they’ve been “freed”. It’s about the ties that exist between people facing the same trauma. And lastly, it’s about how it takes a community to move forward.

I wasn’t able to reach my goal of 36 books, but 20 is still more than I read last year! This year, I hope to read all the books on my to-read list and more. What are you reading? Leave your suggestions in the comments below!
