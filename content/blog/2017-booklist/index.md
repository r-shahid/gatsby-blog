One of my goals at the start of 2017 was to read more books. Here are some of the books I read this year:

* Pet Sematary by Stephen King

  Despite what others have told me, I still don’t think this is as disturbing as a certain scene in IT.

* The Old Man & The Sea by Ernest Hemingway

  I was surprised to find myself emotionally involved enough to root for the old man in this short book.
* The Stranger by Albert Camus

  After having this book recommended to me over and over, all I can say is this was not what I expected.
* Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins

  I really like mystery. I’ll have to read more of those next year.
* Goodbye to All That: Writers on Loving and Leaving New York

  As someone who cannot imagine living outside of NYC, I enjoyed reading about other people’s reasons for staying (and leaving).
* Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse

  Even if you’re not religious in any way, I think this is still a really valuable book to read.
* Leaving Time by Jodi Picoult

  I was NOT A FAN of the twist toward the end but I learned a lot about elephants.
