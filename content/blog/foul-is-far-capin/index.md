**TW: sexual assault/rape culture**

_Foul is Fair_ is a modern retelling of Shakespeare’s _Macbeth_ for the Me Too era. In case you need a refresher, _Macbeth_ is the one where Scottish general, Macbeth, meets three witches who tell him that he will become king. This sends him on a frantic murder-spree as he tries to make the prophecy a reality, goaded on by Lady Macbeth. I’m skipping a lot of details here, but by the end, Lady Macbeth commits suicide and Macbeth is beheaded by a rival. I’m disappointed to say that I had not read Macbeth in a while, so many of the allusions to Shakespeare’s story were lost on me (mainly the similarities in names), but I could see clear parallels throughout the story, save for a huge twist at the end.

Elle was roofied and raped at a party by a group of boys who do this kind of thing all the time to unsuspecting girls. But Elle is not like the other girls — she remembers what happened and she is out to get her revenge. And I have to say, for a book that I went into already knowing the main plot points, I was still surprised at every reveal. Capin’s writing is engrossing in the best way. Even though I knew the story of Macbeth, and even though I knew a book advertising itself as a champion of the #MeToo era would not have a sad ending, _Foul is Fair_ still served as a suspensful read. Reviewing books is kind of _my thing_, but I’m actually a slow reader. That being said, I still finished this book in under a week, which says a lot. 

But all good things aside, this book got a little confusing at times (perhaps _too_ lyrical). There were sections I had to reread a couple times before giving up, moving on, and hoping nothing too important was said. For example, when [mild spoilers ahead] Elle first starts at St. Andrews and she and queen bee Lilia go to the bathroom holding hands, Lilia bursts into what my unqualified-to-diagnose self can only describe as a manic outburst. In response, Elle cuts Lilia with her nails (why??) and Lilia accepts it and laughs at her blood, calling it pretty and remarking on how it’s a display of how alive she is (technically true, but again, WHY??). I spent too long trying to make sense of this exchange before moving on. Later in the story, as we see Lilia’s interactions with the other characters, some of her behaviors start to make sense, but even after finishing the book, I’m still unsure of Lilia’s role at all.  

Overall, I enjoyed this book and would recommend you give it a read. _Foul is Fair_ will be available February 4, 2020 wherever books are sold. To learn more about the author, visit [HannahCapin.com](https://www.hannahcapin.com/).
