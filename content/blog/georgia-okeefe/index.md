The above image is an oil painting by American artist Georgia O’Keefe. At first glance, it looks like a flower but upon closer inspection, it’s apparent that it’s not a specific kind of flower (in regards to both the shape and coloring). This painting is an abstraction in the idea of a flower.

At this time, abstract art was a new and strange thing. But O’Keefe’s title for this piece hints that abstraction has always been a part of Western culture. Like music, painting can have the power of expression without representing anything objective.

Critics of O’Keefe saw in this piece allusions to reproductive organs and argued that this kind of art could only be made by a woman. Her own husband (who had a habit of reading into her work) calls her art an “expression of the sort of eternal female”. But comments like these only reveal more about the critic than the work being critiqued, according to O’Keefe, who takes pleasure in the slipperiness of trying to categorize her work. O’Keefe doesn’t think of her work as tied exclusively to the female body, but rather expressions of natural forms.

This painting is currently on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
