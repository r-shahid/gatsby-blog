When I was younger, I never really appreciated Eid as much as I should have. Granted, I used to fast for only two or three days out of the required 30, so there was no significant difference between one of the days of Ramadan and Eid ul-Fitr. For me, it was just a day when my mom made her most special dishes and my relatives slipped me some money via handshake.

But as I got older (and once fasting became compulsory for me), I began to see Eid in a different light. It marked the end of fasting daily. It marked the end of having to wake up at 3 am every day for suhoor and dealing with the resulting messed-up sleep schedule. It marked the end of constantly worrying about my breath and leaning away from people when talking. But it also marked the end of the holiest month in the Islamic calendar. It marked the “deadline” for many of the typical Ramadan goals (finish the entire Qur’an, memorize some surahs, etc.). It marked a day that would come to represent countless failures over the years.

Many people enter the month of Ramadan thinking only about what they will do to strengthen themselves spiritually; the best ways to build their imaan. But people forget that fasting — especially fasting every day for 30 (or 29) days — demands a lot from the body. It takes a lot of strength to wake up before the sun rises and eat a meal, knowing that you won’t eat or drink anything else until the sun sets. It is hard to wake up at all when many of us (myself in particular) are sleep deprived anyway from their daily schedules. It is a huge challenge when you still have to go to work/school and run the usual errands, especially in the summer heat. Everyone wants to do the things that will benefit them in the hereafter, but what do you do when you can’t escape the limits of your own body?

It is for this reason that this past Ramadan has been the first where I am more realistic with my spiritual goals. This Ramadan has been more about being honest with myself. It was about knowing that I probably won’t be able to finish the Qur’an a certain number of times or memorize a certain number of surahs. But more importantly, it was about accepting that this is okay. I know that my worth as a person and as a Muslim is not measured just by the quantities of my accomplishments. It is measured by the honest effort that goes into my actions.
