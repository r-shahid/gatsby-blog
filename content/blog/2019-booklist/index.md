### The End of A Chapter

One of my first blog posts was my Impossible List. It‚Äôs like a bucket-list on steroids; you write down things that seem out of reach instead of things that you could do but just haven‚Äôt gotten around to doing. Mine certainly needs updating, since I‚Äôve accomplished many of my goals, but one that I am still working toward is my reading goal. I didn‚Äôt reach my goal of 36 books in 2019, but I found some great stories along the way.

                <b>MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS</b><br>
                A classic if you love a mystery! I would highly recommend you watch the movie as well. I saw the original, 1974 version at a MoMA screening.

                <b>THE GROWNUP</b><br>
                I really enjoyed <i>Gone Girl</i>, so I wanted to read more by Flynn. <i>The Grownup</i> did not disappoint!

                <b>THE SCIENCE OF SUCCESS</b><br>
                To be completely honest, I picked up this book thinking it was another one of a similar name. This book was NOT what I expected, but I got some motivational quotes out of it. This book is worth the read if you are into Law of Attraction or mindset-based goal-setting.

                <b>YOU VS YOU</b><br>
                I‚Äôm mildly obsessed with self-help books, so I have fairly high standards when it comes to this genre. You vs You breaks down your breakthrough into 12 ‚Äúbattles‚Äù that you can tackle one by one. Click the image to read my full review and get a peek at some of these battles.

                <b>SALVAGE THE BONES</b><br>
                Salvage the Bones is a gritty novel that you will remember for a long time.

                <b>THE FURIES</b><br>
                In this story, a group of teenagers tap into the witchy history of their school to enact revenge on people who wronged them or know too much. It also touches on the different kinds of relationships that develop during adolescence and their role in shaping teens‚Äô lives. Click the image to read more.

                <b>PARK AVENUE SUMMER</b><br>
                This is a historical fiction novel about the revamp-ing of Cosmopolitan magazine by Helen Gurley Brown. Cosmo has become a little bit of a meme at this point, but before it became a successful magazine, it was on the verge of being shut down. HGB brought this dying magazine back to life and set a new precedent for the type of person who can be in charge. Click the image to read more.

            <div>
                <b>THE GIRL HE USED TO KNOW</b><br>
                This is a really cute story! It‚Äôs officially categorized as women‚Äôs fiction, but it‚Äôs mainly a suspenseful romance. Click the image to read my review.

            <div>
                <b>THE QUEEN</b><br>
                This was a shift from the fiction books I usually read, and to be honest, I thought I would be bored. But <i>The Queen</i> is so interesting in it‚Äôs content that I cannot imagine anyone disliking this book. It‚Äôs about a woman, who has so many aliases that I don‚Äôt even know what to call her, and her lifelong series of scams and tricks to get rich and stay rich. Click the image to read more.

            <div>
                <b>LAST DAY</b><br>
                The premise of <i>Last Day</i> is that everyyone knows the date of the end of the world, but no one knows if it‚Äôll happen this year. The occasion is marked by celebration, airing out regrets, and all the internal turmoil you can imagine. Click the image to read more.

                <i>Firewall</i> is a thriller that ties in blackmail, cyber crimes, and a LOT of suspense. Click the image to read my full review.

                <b>FLYING ALONE</b><br>
                <i>Flying Alone</i> is based on the true experiences of pilot and photographer Beth Ruggiero York. It‚Äôs a well-written book about the struggles in becoming a certified pilot in an environment and time that did not encourage these kinds of achievements for women. Click the image to read more.

                <b>THE 48 LAWS OF POWER</b><br>
                This is a collection of life lessons, complete with historial examples to back them up. I enjoy this genre of writing, so this is the kind of book I would reread several times.

            <div>
                <b>RUN AWAY</b><br>
                This was one of the first books I ever reviewed on my website. It was also the only book that I didn‚Äôt really like. There were just so many unsatisfying aspects to it, in my opinion. That being said, it‚Äôs a thriller, so you might enjoy it anyway.

                <b>THE ONE THING</b><br>
                This is another book on productivity. In it, Keller talks about the most important steps anyone can take to make sure they are able to do everything on their to-do lists.

            <div>
                <b>THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE</b><br>
                Neil Gaiman is a treasure and no book on this list is as endearing as this one.

            <div>
                <b>THE MARS ROOM</b><br>
                In <i>The Mars Room</i>, Rachel Kushner tells a really great story about a group of women in jail and one as she tries anything she can to try to get back to her ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life.

            <div>
                <b>BARBARA THE SLUT</b><br>
                This is a collection of short stories that are funny and #relatable. This is a very quick, pleasant read, so I would recommend it if you don‚Äôt see yourself as a huge reader. The stories were varied, so there‚Äôs something in here for everybody. Overall, I thought this book was okay. Critics of this book say that the stories were too typical, but I don‚Äôt think every book needs to be groundbreaking.

                <b>ROUGE</b><br>
                This is a historical fan-fiction type of story about Helena Rubenstein and Elizabeth Arden. These two were pioneers of the cosmetics industry (long before every other celebritry had their own makeup line). This book captures that energy and throws in lots of drama and emotions.

            <div>
                <b>WHEN BREATH BECOMES AIR</b><br>
                If there‚Äôs one book you pick up from this list, please read this one! Paul Kalanithi trained for years and years to become a neurosurgeon. But soon after he made it, he was diagnosed with stage IV cancer and suddenly became a patient, like the ones he used to treat. This memoir is a moving tale that tackles the meaning of life, what still matters when facing mortality, and what it‚Äôs like when you only have the present to look forward to.

            <div>
                <b>THE INSTITUTE</b><br>
                I couldn‚Äôt end this list without at least a couple Stephen King books! <i>The Institute</i> is about an organization that kidnaps children who all have one thing in common: telekenesis and/or telepathy. While this is nefarious enough on its own, this organization is also harnessing the kids‚Äô power to kill people the organization deems as a threat. I‚Äôm a huge fan of King‚Äôs writing, so it‚Äôs no surprise that I enjoyed this as well. The biggest complaints I‚Äôve seen about <i>The Institue</i> is that King gives some of his chracters the same anti-Trump views that he has. I didn‚Äôt think he included politics often enough for it to get annoying, but I imagine the brief mentions would be more grating to people who don‚Äôt share King‚Äôs views. Some people would say that politics have no place in fiction. As an author, why would you want to alienate the part of your audience who does not agree with you? To that, I say because they can. Many authors, like Stephen King, have a huge following. Famous authors have cultivated a platform that they can (and should) use for the important things that matter to them. 
            </div>

        <div class="book-long-desc-alt">
            <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rshahid/image/upload/v1609488050/gatsby-blog-post-pics/519PGx6pEyL._SX351_BO1204203200__n0qnre.jpg" alt="cover"/>
            <div>
                <b>ELEVATION</b><br>
                <i>Elevation</i> takes place in Castle Rock and references other King stories. Speaking of the others, this is a much shorter story than any of his other books. It features Scott, who suddenly seems to be getting lighter, without losing mass. It‚Äôs as if more and more of his body is filling up with helium. While dealing with this, he also faces some more normal problems, like bad neighbors and typical small town altercations. I‚Äôm going to be honest, this is a weird book and feels very different from other King novels. If you‚Äôre a diehard fan of his usual style of writing, you might not enjoy this one as much. I read so many kinds of books on my blog, so I don‚Äôt mind the change.
            </div>

So that‚Äôs every book I read in 2019! While putting this blog post together, I was a little shocked to realize that I _really_ read these books in only the past year. It feels like I‚Äôm remembering them from a completely different lifetime. 2019 was a _long_ year for me. I‚Äôm sure 2020 will feel the same, but I‚Äôm looking forward to all the new stories I‚Äôll come across.
